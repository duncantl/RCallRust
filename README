This is a very simple example of calling Rust routines from R.
This uses the Rffi package to call the routines directly without
the need for a wrapper routine. We could use Dan Adler's rdyncall package
also.

I've also added an example of using .C.

``` shell
make
```

In R
``` R
source("call.R", verbose = TRUE)
```

Currently, this doesn't show how to active the Rust run-time system.
